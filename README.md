In the folder "RFCT_Mismatches" one will find the associated data and code to develop the app which is linked above. The app is a visualization of the research conducted under Dr. Fournier with the supervision of the Dr. Ruhi and Dr. Carlson. Under a grant recieved from the California Department of fish and wildlife, this project explores through the lens of population viability analysis, the possible critical decline probabilities of fish species and their prey zooplankton in the San Francisco Bay System. Observed on an annual scale, only months where collection occured and species were prevelant were considered and this was then used to forecast up to 10 years in the future using a field standard forecasting algorithm. Analysis of the temporal drift and the covariate affects among species were considered. Segmentation of defined "communities" was done across common regions in the Bay system.


We also have "MFRC_Mismatches", which is the project that I will be leading under the guidance of Ruhi, Fournier, Carlson. I will be adapting the work originally from Denise Colombano, a former Postdoc at UC Berkeley Freshwater. We will be analysing how the environmental covariates (water: salinity, temperature, quality) influence the phenological patterns of species (fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton) in the San Francisco Bay/Estuary.
